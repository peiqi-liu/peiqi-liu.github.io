<p class="f0-light">Hello, I am Mahi!</p>
<!-- <p><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35402e9112d76326f74f0e141591f4e1?s=512" alt="Me, Mahi"></p> -->
<p>
    I am a fourth-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at <a href='https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html'
        target="_blank">NYU Courant</a> working primarily with <a href="https://lerrelpinto.com" target="_blank">Prof.
        Lerrel Pinto</a>.
    I work on machine learning problems that allow robots to learn both from humans and on their own.
    Recently, I was a visiting scientist at <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Fundamental AI Research
        (FAIR)</a> at Meta with <a href="https://imisra.github.io/" target="_blank">Ishan Misra</a>.

    I am grateful for the <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/apple-scholars-aiml-2023"
        target="_blank">2023 Apple Scholars in AI/ML PhD fellowship</a> for supporting my research.

    <p>Right now, my research goal is to figure out how to get robots to cohabitate and collaborate with us in a
        household settings. If you are not a robotics person, think of it this way: I plan to retire when I can tell a
        robot to cook me <a

            target="_blank">khichuri</a>,
        and it can just look up recipes on YouTube and cook it for me.</p>
    <p>Before this, I was at MIT, working on Robust Machine Learning with <a href="https://madry-lab.ml"
            target="_blank">Prof. Aleksander
            Madry</a>, where I got my Masters and Undergraduate degrees.</p>
    <p>Besides my graduate research, I keep busy doing a variety of different things. Just in 2020, I was helping
        Bangladesh
        with <a href="https://notmahi.github.io/bd-rt-dashboard/" target="_blank">COVID-19 data analytics</a> with their
        <a href="https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2020/06/03/ndatf-to-help-bangladesh-government-to-flag-covid-19-risk-zones"
            target="_blank">National
            Data Analytics Task Force</a>, and helping a university transition to online learning. Since then, I&#39;ve
        also helped out a friend&#39;s <a href="https://affinedefi.com/" target="_blank">startup</a> with some
        quantitative analytics. On
        my free time, I like reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13481789" target="_blank">books</a>,
        and visiting
        the large trove of museums in New York.
