<p class="f0-light">Hello, I am Peiqi!</p>
<p>
    I am currently a robotics engineer intern at <a href='https://hello-robot.com'
        target="_blank">Hello Robot</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://cpaxton.github.io/about/" target="_blank">Dr. Chris Paxton</a> and 
        a research assistant at <a href='https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html'
        target="_blank">NYU Courant</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://lerrelpinto.com" target="_blank">Prof.
        Lerrel Pinto</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I am currently focused on robot semantic memory, open vocabulary navigation, vision launguage models.
    Besides this, I am also interested in long horizon robotics and mobile manipulation in general.
    My short term goal is to transfer powerful zero shot vision and multi-modal models into open vocabulary visual grounding systems that can be used in robot navigation. 
    My long term goal is to build generalist robots working life long.

    <p>Right now, my research goal is to figure out how to get robots to cohabitate and collaborate with us in a
        household settings. If you are not a robotics person, think of it this way: I plan to retire when I can tell a
        robot to cook me <a

            target="_blank">khichuri</a>,
        and it can just look up recipes on YouTube and cook it for me.</p>
    <p>Before this, I was at MIT, working on Robust Machine Learning with <a href="https://madry-lab.ml"
            target="_blank">Prof. Aleksander
            Madry</a>, where I got my Masters and Undergraduate degrees.</p>
    <p>Besides my graduate research, I keep busy doing a variety of different things. Just in 2020, I was helping
        Bangladesh
        with <a href="https://notmahi.github.io/bd-rt-dashboard/" target="_blank">COVID-19 data analytics</a> with their
        <a href="https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2020/06/03/ndatf-to-help-bangladesh-government-to-flag-covid-19-risk-zones"
            target="_blank">National
            Data Analytics Task Force</a>, and helping a university transition to online learning. Since then, I&#39;ve
        also helped out a friend&#39;s <a href="https://affinedefi.com/" target="_blank">startup</a> with some
        quantitative analytics. On
        my free time, I like reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13481789" target="_blank">books</a>,
        and visiting
        the large trove of museums in New York.
